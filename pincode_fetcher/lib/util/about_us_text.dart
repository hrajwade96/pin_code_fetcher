History 

History has that the pin code system was the brainchild of Mr. Shriram Bhikaji Velankar (the then Additional Secretary in the union ministry of communication). He came up with this system on August 15, 1972, as a medium to simplify the manual sorting and delivery of correspondence. It works by eliminating the mix-up of wrong addresses, primarily caused by places with similar names and the use of varied languages by people. 

Mr. Shriram Bhikaji Velankar (Additional Secretary in the union ministry of communication), introduced this system on 15th August 1972, to simplify the sorting and delivery of correspondence. To avoid the mix up of incorrect addresses, caused because of similar names and the usage of different languages by people. 

The system was originally formulated by the USSR and then gradually it has been adapted by other countries. In some countries Postal codes are all numerical but some use an alphanumeric system. 

PIN Code vs ZIP Code 

Zonal Improvement Plan (ZIP) codes system was introduced by the USA during the 1960s to ease the mail sorting process. It has 5 digits referring to the national area, district post office and local post office, respectively. 

As compared to that, the Postal Index Number (PIN) code system is native to India. It is exactly the same concept as Zonal Improvement Plan (ZIP) Code which has 5 digits, instead of that Postal Index Number (PIN) has 6 digits. 

Both coding systems have the same concept in sorting out mails and figuring out the exact location for delivering in an effective and efficient manner. 

Decoding the Postal Index Number 

To simply manage, the Indian Postal Service has assigned 9 specific Postal Index Number (PIN) regions across India, out of which 8 was allotted to geographical regions and the 9th is reserved to the Indian Army known as functional zone. 

Each 6-digit PINcode has a particular meaning. 

The first digit assigned to the overall geographical region. 

The second digit is designated to the postal circle or sub region. 

The third digit is allotted to the sorting district. 

Last 3 digits collectively indicate the specific Post Office in the district. 

For Example: 

The Postal Index Number of Central Delhi is 110001 

1 = Region in India 

1 = Sub region in India 

0 = Sorting District 

0 = Post Office 

0 = Post Office 

1 = Post Office
